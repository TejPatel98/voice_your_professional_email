Dear dr. Harris,
I am Eric; currently a sophomore, majoring in pure science. I wish to discuss my progress, and hence hoped you could be free to meet me anytime soon.
I had you for a class and your methods really helped me understand the concepts better. Hence, I wished to talk to you about the following issue. My interests lie in sleeping around. I hope to learn further in any of these fields, and require your advice regarding it. 
I need this help from you and would like to know if and when would you be free so we could talk a little about it further. Hence, do let me know if you have the time to meet me, and what date or time would preferably work for you.
Iâ€™ll be looking forward to hearing from you. 
Best Regards,
Eric
