Dear dr. seales,

My name is josh baunach, and Iâ€™m in your cs 335 class. I would like to schedule an appointment with you to discuss my progress in this class. I would like to discuss what we are currently learning and I would like to properly introduce myself because I like to be close to my professors, so if I ever need help in the course, I can ask without hesitating. This course will be very helpful to me. So, it is important for me to understand and do my best in the class, so it will carry me far in my professional career. Please send me a time and date that suits you best so we can have a formal meeting. 

Best regards, 
josh baunach
